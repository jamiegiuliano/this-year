# ThisYear

Flatiron School - Sinatra Final Portfolio Project

Years seems to pass incredibly fast and before you know it, those resolutions from the beginning of the year
are forgotten and your left wondering "What actually happened this year?"
That's where ThisYear comes in!
ThisYear helps you remember the resolutions you made in the beginning of the year, while also tracking the
events that happened throughout the year- big or small!
Whether you started your dream career or finally
tried that fancy restaurant you've been dying to check out- ThisYear compiles all of your moments so
you can look back and reminisce on all the fun things you've accomplished come December.
